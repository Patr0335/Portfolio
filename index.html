        <h2>Personal Profile: </h2>
        <hr>
        <div class="mydiv">
            <p>I would describe myself as an enthusiastic, happy and outgoing person who is not afraid to take
                responsibility. <br>Through my training and experience I have had the opportunity to work in various
                forms of
                cooperation, where I typically have taken responsibility and coordinator role. <br>Over the last 1,5
                year I have
                gained increasing responsibilities at my job at the International school of Hellerup and It’s after
                school care
                program (ACSP) e.g. in charge of sports. <br>My year at Paul Petersen's sports institute has not only
                challenged
                me theoretically, but also increased my skills in education and sports.
